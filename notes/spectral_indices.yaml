  https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/21/15444: the visible range (400–700 nm) can indicate the presence
  of organic matter and iron oxide minerals. Near-infrared reflectance (700–1300 nm) is sensitive to
  soil moisture content and clay mineralogy. Shortwave infrared reflectance (1300–2500 nm) can be used
  to estimate soil organic carbon content and identify specific minerals like gypsum or calcite [61].

  Enhanced Vegetation Index (https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-enhanced-vegetation-index)
  designed to enhance the vegetation signal with improved sensitivity in high biomass regions and
  improved vegetation monitoring through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction
  in atmosphere influences.
  evi2 and evi22 are 2 Band EVIs. Signal to noise ratios for blue are often problematic.

  Clay Minerals (also "alteration"): This ratio leverages the fact that hydrous minerals such as the clays,
  alunite absorb radiation in the 2.0–2.3 micron portion of the spectrum. This index mitigates
  illumination changes due to terrain since it is a ratio.

  The Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) method is a vegetation index for estimating photo
  synthetic activity and is a commonly used vegetation index to determine water and nitrogen uptake into the
  plant canopy.

  This index was originally designed with color-infrared photography to predict nitrogren requirements for corn.
  It is similar to SAVI, but it substitutes the green band for red.
