title: Spectral Trend Database
subtitle: a historcal database spectral indices
abstract: |
    DSEâ€™s Spectral Trends Database monitors uses data from NASA's Landsat satellites to track over 14,000 points in corn and soy fields in the midwestern United States. The database contains daily values for 36 different vegetation indices from the year 2000 to present, along with a number of derivative metrics that are useful for detecting crop planting and harvesting. The data will be useful for myriad agriculture applications, including the study and monitoring of yield, yield-stability, soil
    health, cover-cropping, and other sustainable agricultural practices.

    Schmidt DSE is now beginning to explore this data with a particular focus on yield-stability and cover-cropping (our collaborators at the US Department of Agriculture are particularly interested in the latter). Because this database will be public, our hope is that the data will help empower and accelerate research and action in the agricultural field more broadly.  Moreover, we are releasing an open-source codebase so that researchers can quickly generate new databases for their own locations and metrics of interest.
